<h2><u>Layout</u></h2>
<p>
abKey is arranged in alphabetical order, in
logical and purposeful groups. The most
common keys are grouped and darkened:
left-hand side are vowels AEIOU, on the righthand side: RST, the most common consonants,
and the common Space and Return keys.
The less common keys are in lighter shade,
but also arranged in easy to remember groupsBCD, FGH, JK, LMN, PQ, VW, XYZ - and related
to AEIOU and RST (the home rows).
Generally and visibly, the keys are in order
from A (extreme left) to Z (extreme right.)
They’re also in straight rows and columns to 
improve accuracy.
</p>

<h2><u>Keyboard Settings Key</u></h2>
<p>
Enter Settings by clicking the key left of the
Spacebar. You may enable or disable T+ and Tr,
and access the rT+ Manager which allows you
to see, edit, replace and delete your stored
data. You may also select or deselect functions
for Capitals and Spelling.
</p>

<h2><u>Super Keys: T+ and Tr</u></h2>
<p>
There are 2 super keys unique to abKey:<br>
T+, Tr<br>
<b>T+ allows you to store data</b> in 5 bins in
the Lite Version and up to 58 bins in
Premium.<br>
Step 1: Click T+ followed by an alphabet/
number/or accented character key<br>
Step 2: A text box opens up for you to
type or<br>
paste your text. If you get the message
“This key slot is not empty” and continue 
typing,<br>
and SAVE, you’ll be over-writing the 
stored data in the bin.<br>
Or click CANCEL and choose another bin.
[NOTE: Premium allows you to enter new
data without over-writing previous entries;
and selectively retrieve from multiple
entries in a bin.]<br>
<b>Tr allows you to retrieve data</b> that
you’ve stored. Click Tr followed by the 
alphabet/ number/accented character key
indicating the bin containing your data.
Your data will appear at the cursor.
